# The Power of Predictionüí∞

Recently, I have been studying very wealthy people to understand what led them to their wealth and made them who they are today. As I look back, only one word comes to mind:

**Prediction.**


## You Don't Cash Out by Following the Herdüìâ

If you look at all wealthy individuals, they made predictions about something, and they were right, which allowed them to build massive fortunes.

For example, investors become wealthy by making investments that eventually hold significant value in the economy, even when no one else believes in them. That is how they gain wealth. If everyone believed something was the next big thing, and it actually turned out to be true, then the wealth would be distributed among many people. There would be less opportunity for individuals to stand out financially.

Even now, I still find it surprising that something as simple as making predictions can make someone very wealthy. The truth is, we all make predictions every day, unconsciously, without even realizing it. But the wealthy make conscious decisions and hold strong belief in each of their predictions.


## They're Wrong, Mostly‚ùå

You might say, they are probably wrong the majority of the time. And you‚Äôre not wrong. Most investors do get a lot of things wrong. But they only need to be right once. They might have had four failed investments, and the fifth one becomes the jackpot. Who knows.

Now they are making predictions from a place of wealth. But what about when they were just starting out? Did they also make predictions then? Actually, they did. But instead of spreading their energy across multiple ideas, they put their heart into one and went all in.

You can see this now with companies like Nvidia, which went all in on microprocessors. But the scary thing about making predictions is that you have to be told you‚Äôre wrong many, many times by many people, even by those you love deeply.
